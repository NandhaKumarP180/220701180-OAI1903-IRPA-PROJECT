Important Notice
Regarding Attendance Requirements

Dear Madhav, 

It has come to our attention that some students are not meeting the minimum attendance requirements 
for this semester. As a reminder, maintaining regular attendance is crucial for both your academic 
progress and eligibility for examinations. Low attendance not only impacts your understanding of the 
course material but may also lead to serious consequences, including a lack of examination eligibility.

Please take note of the following guidelines:

1. Minimum Attendance Requirement: Students are required to maintain at least 75% attendance in 
each subject to be eligible for semester exams, as per our academic regulations.

2. Regular Monitoring: Attendance will be monitored regularly. If your attendance falls below the 
required percentage, you may receive warnings or may be required to meet with academic advisors.

3. Attendance Improvement Plans: If you are facing challenges that affect your attendance, please 
reach out to your faculty advisor. We are here to help and can discuss potential solutions.

We urge all students to prioritize attending classes and make the most of the learning opportunities 
available to you. For any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact the department office.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

Best regards,
Sharukesh
